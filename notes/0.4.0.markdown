### Obligatory Upgrade

Because github is [terminating its v2 APIs][gh] on May 1, 2012 and
these are used by all earlier versions of conscript, you must upgrade in
order to continue using the software.

Luckily, upgrading conscript is easy:

    cs n8han/conscript

Do it now while your copy still works!

### Improvements

* Uses Dispatch reboot [to retrieve templates][reboot], concurrently
* Added `--no-exec` switch to bypass command execution after install { [n8han][noexec] }
* Use BuildInfo to display current version { [eed3si9n][vers] }
* Use something called `git.exe` on Windows { [eed3si9n][git] }
* Will still work after May 1, 2012
