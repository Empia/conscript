* Private repository support for conscript [avalade](https://github.com/n8han/conscript/pull/23)

### Upgrading

To upgrade conscript and the sbt launcher stored in `~/.conscript`,
run the [installation jar][jar].

### Plugin

For application authors, the conscript plugin has also been
updated. Use the new way of specify plugin dependencies:

    addSbtPlugin("net.databinder" % "conscript-plugin" % "0.3.2")

And in your `build.sbt` or other build definition, you will now
need to explicitly apply conscript settings:

    seq(conscriptSettings :_*)

For new applications, the [giter8 template][g8] is up-to-date.
