This release adds github OAuth support and restores access to private
repositories, which was [non-functional in the last release][private].

[private]: https://github.com/n8han/conscript/issues/39

To authenticate and store a permanent token, use the `--auth` parameter:

    cs --auth yourname:yourpass

This stores an access token in `~/.conscript/config` which is used for
all future `cs` invocations. You can revoke tokens at any time in your
[github account settings][tokens].
