sbt 0.10 launcher
-----------------

Conscript now installs by default the sbt 0.10.0 launcher, which is
backwards compatible with the sbt 0.7.x launchers used
previously. Applications do not need to make any changes.

Windows Support
---------------

Thanks [eed3si9n](https://github.com/eed3si9n/)! Conscript now has a
runnable jar installer, and will produce batch files instead of shell
scripts as needed.

New Commands
------------

Also thanks to eed3si9n, conscript can use templates stored on github
branches. Just use the `--branch` parameter. For example:

    cs ghname/project --branch unstable

Additionally the artifact version contained in a template can be
overridden like so:

    cs ghname/project/theversion

First Run
---------

When conscript applies a template it creates a startup script and a
launchconfig, but it's not until you first run the script that any
needed dependencies are fetched by the launcher.

To avoid surprises down the road, conscript now invokes commands as
soon as it installs them, passing in a `--version` parameter. This
causes needed dependencies to be fetched, and will display the newly
installed app's version number (or an error message if it doesn't
support the parameter).
